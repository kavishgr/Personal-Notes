# 79 - Pentesting Finger

## **Basic Info**

**Finger** is a program you can use to find information about computer users. It usually lists the login name, the full name, and possibly other details about the user you are fingering. These details may include the office location and phone number \(if known\), login time, idle time, time mail was last read, and the user's plan and project files.

**Default port:** 79

```text
PORT   STATE SERVICE
79/tcp open  finger

nc -vn <IP> 79
```

## **User enumeration**
